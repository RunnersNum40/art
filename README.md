# Generative Art

This repo showcases some of my experiments with generative art.

## K-means Voronoi

[The script](src/k_means_voronoi.py) generates a Voronoi diagram using a k-means clustering algorithm. It clusters pixels from an image and then generates a Voronoi diagram based on the cluster centers. The images are generated by using the cluster center color only in the pixel position space.
